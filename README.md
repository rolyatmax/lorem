A work in progress. This is the beginning of an experimental plugin which takes a block of text and transforms it into a collection of nodes representing each word in the block. The user can then apply effects to the words: blacking them out (a la "newspaper blackout poetry") or animating them into place.

This example randomly selects words from quotations of famous works of literature with the goal of creating accidental poetry.
